# snake
A remake of my first ever programming project, with a project organization that doesn't actively suck.

## Why did I make this?

Nostalgia. Burnout/Depression. Disillusionment from academia. Wanting to remember why I got into coding.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/imsasankvindamuri/snake.git
cd snake
pipx install .
```

Run using...

```
snake
```
